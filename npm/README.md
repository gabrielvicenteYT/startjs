# NPM

## What is NPM?

NPM is a package manager. A Package is a piece of code that is used like an app, and designed to be used by other JS projects. NPM stores installed modules in a folder called node\_modules. Do not touch files in this folder, nor a file called package-lock.json Why Would you use NPM? NPM is a way to save time. Rather than making your own piece of code you could just use a prebuilt one. This is what NPM is about.

## Why Does StartJS not use NPM?

StartJS uses Yarn as it is easier, faster and more secure than NPM. Before Starting ANY Project, please read [our Yarn Installation Guide](yarn.md)
