# All About Yarn

## What is Yarn?

Yarn is an alternative installer for NPM packages. Yarn is more secure, easier to use, has multi-project support and is faster than NPM. In this Tutorial, I will be showing you how to Install Yarn, Initialize a Folder using Yarn and much more. NOTE tat there is expected setup explained in our [Starting Tutorial](/start.md)

## Installing Yarn

Installing Yarn is the one time that we will be using NPM. Simply run the below command in an app called Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS/Linux). We do not Support ChromeOS.

```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

Then wait for it to finish. Once that's done, that is Yarn Installed. Easy, Right?
